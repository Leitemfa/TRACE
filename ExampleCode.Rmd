This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to run the code developed in the paper [Infinite joint species distribution models.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13384).

The functions in TRACEh.cpp are written in C++ using the Rcpp and RcppArmadillo libraries, which are designed to be called from R. Hereâ€™s how you can run them:

### 1. From R (Recommended)

These functions are meant to be used inside R as part of an R package or R script. You can call the [[Rcpp::export]]-tagged functions directly from R after sourcing or building the package.

Do not forget to update your R console and download the latest version of Rtools prior to running this script

#### Steps:

**a. Install Rcpp and RcppArmadillo in R (if not already installed):**

```{r}
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("RcppArmadillo")
```



**b. Source the C++ file in R (if not building a package):**

```{r}
library(Rcpp)
sourceCpp("TRACEh.cpp")
```

This will compile the C++ code and export the functions to your R session.

**c. Call the exported functions from R:**
For example:

```{r}
# Example call (use actual data for Y and X)
result <- MVP_IBPh(Y, X, eta0_rho, nu0_rho, gamma0_rho, lambda0_sq_rho, a_alpha, b_alpha, prior_var, max_it, epsilon, m, nmcmc, burnin, nmcmc_a, burnin_a, eps_MH, truncP)
```


### 2. As Part of an R Package

If the repo provides an R package interface (look for an R/ directory or DESCRIPTION file), you should install the package following its README instructions, and then call the functions from R as documented.

### 3. Not Standalone C++ Code

You cannot run these functions directly from a C++ compiler or command line unless you set up an interface with Rcpp; they depend on Rcpp and RcppArmadillo, and some functions call R internals (e.g., R::qnorm).
